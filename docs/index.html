				Qunnect4 is a quantum adaptation of the classic game Connect 4, designed to 
				illustrate the counterintuitive aspects of quantum phenomena such as 
				superposition, collapse, and entanglement.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this game, a red-blue yin yang symbol 
				<img src="images/yinyang_color.png" class="yinyang"> represents a superposed 
				token, simulating a bichromatic photon in a superposition of two energy 
				states - or colors. When a superposed token 
				<img src="images/yinyang_color.png" class="yinyang"> is measured, it collapses
				to <img src="images/dot_red.png" class="dot"> or 
				<img src="images/dot_blue.png" class="dot">.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tokens are grouped in pairs. A pair of tokens, named with same greek letter, 
				are entangled. In other words, if one token is measured and collapses to 
				<img src="images/dot_red.png" class="dot">, the other token will collapse
				to <img src="images/dot_blue.png" class="dot"> simultaneously, and vice versa. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A player places a pair of entangled tokens each turn. This is different to
				Connect 4, in which only one token is placed.
			</p>
			<p>
				To prevent a cycling condition, where one player always collapses the tokens
				placed by the other, a player is not allowed to collapse an unmeasurable token,
				represented by a gray out yin yang symbol 
				<img src="images/yinyang_gray.png" class="yinyang">. An unmeasurable token
				<img src="images/yinyang_gray.png" class="yinyang"> becomes measureable 
				<img src="images/yinyang_color.png" class="yinyang"> after its row or column is 
				fully occupied. This rule ensures a fair and balanced gameplay experience for 
				both players.
			</p>
